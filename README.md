# CallRec
My call diarization-recognition app:
---------------------------------------------
Records your calls and saves them in .wav format

Diarizes them (separates dictors) using LIUM

Sends pieces to YandexSpeachCloud to recognize russian speech

Shows final dialog in text form

TODO:
-----------------------
Different diarization method

Phonebook Sync

UI

etc.
